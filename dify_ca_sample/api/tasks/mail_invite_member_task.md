### Summary

Here's an overall summary of the codebase:

The `mail_invite_member_task.py` file contains a Celery task called `send_invite_member_mail_task` that is responsible for sending an email invitation to a member to join a workspace.

The main functionality of the task includes:

1. Checking if the mail extension is initialized before attempting to send the email.
2. Logging the start of the email sending process, including the recipient's email and the workspace name.
3. Constructing the email content based on the provided language (either English or Simplified Chinese) using Jinja2 templates.
4. Sending the email using the `mail.send()` method provided by the `ext_mail` extension.
5. Logging the success or failure of the email sending process, including the latency.

The task is designed to be called asynchronously using the `delay()` method, which allows the email sending to be executed in the background without blocking the main application.

The task takes the following parameters:
- `language`: The language of the email content (either 'zh-Hans' or 'en-US').
- `to`: The recipient's email address.
- `token`: A token used in the activation URL.
- `inviter_name`: The name of the person who invited the recipient.
- `workspace_name`: The name of the workspace the recipient is being invited to.

Overall, this codebase provides a way to send email invitations to workspace members asynchronously, with the ability to customize the email content based on the recipient's language.

### Highlights

The key features of this code are:

1. **Asynchronous Task**: The code uses a Celery shared task `send_invite_member_mail_task` to send the invite member email asynchronously. This is a common pattern for handling long-running or resource-intensive operations in web applications.

2. **Conditional Mail Initialization**: The code checks if the mail extension is initialized before attempting to send the email. This ensures that the email functionality is only used when it's properly set up.

3. **Multilingual Support**: The code supports sending the invite member email in two different languages: Simplified Chinese (`zh-Hans`) and English (`en-US`). It uses Jinja2 templates to render the email content in the appropriate language.

4. **Logging and Timing**: The code logs the start and end of the email sending process, along with the latency. This can be useful for monitoring and troubleshooting.

5. **Dynamic URL Generation**: The code generates a dynamic URL for the activation link, using the `CONSOLE_WEB_URL` configuration and the token parameter.

Overall, the key focus of this code is to provide a robust and flexible way to send invite member emails asynchronously, with support for multiple languages and logging/timing functionality.```python

                                           workspace_name=workspace_name,
                                           url=url)
            mail.send(to=to, subject="Join Dify Workspace Now", html=html_content)

        # Log the successful completion of the task
        end_at = time.perf_counter()
        logging.info(click.style(f'Send invite member mail to {to} succeeded: latency: {end_at - start_at}', fg='green'))
    except Exception:
        # Log the failure of the task
        logging.exception(f"Send invite member mail to {to} failed")
```

This pseudocode follows a high-level, Pythonic approach to the problem. It defines a Celery shared task called `send_invite_member_mail_task` that is responsible for sending an invite member email. The task takes five parameters: `language`, `to`, `token`, `inviter_name`, and `workspace_name`.

The task first checks if the mail extension is initialized. If not, it simply returns without doing anything. Then, it logs the start of the task and measures the time it takes to complete the task.

Inside the try-except block, the task constructs the activation URL using the provided token and the application's configuration. It then renders the email template based on the specified language and sends the email using the `mail.send()` function.

If the email is sent successfully, the task logs the successful completion and the latency. If an exception occurs, the task logs the failure.

Overall, this pseudocode provides a high-level, Pythonic approach to the problem, with clear separation of concerns, error handling, and performance logging.
