### Summary

This Python file `add_annotation_to_index_task.py` defines a Celery task called `add_annotation_to_index_task` that is responsible for adding an annotation to an index. Here's a summary of the key components and their functionalities:

1. **Imports**:
   - The file imports various modules and classes from the codebase, including `logging`, `time`, `click`, `celery`, and classes from the `core.rag`, `models`, and `services` packages.

2. **Celery Task Definition**:
   - The `add_annotation_to_index_task` function is defined as a Celery shared task with the `queue='dataset'` parameter. This means that the task will be executed in the `dataset` queue.
   - The task takes several parameters: `annotation_id`, `question`, `tenant_id`, `app_id`, and `collection_binding_id`.

3. **Task Implementation**:
   - The task starts by logging a message indicating that the index building process has started for the given `annotation_id`.
   - It then retrieves the `DatasetCollectionBindingService` object by the `collection_binding_id` and the type `'annotation'`.
   - A `Dataset` object is created with the provided `app_id`, `tenant_id`, and other metadata related to the indexing technique, embedding model provider, and collection binding.
   - A `Document` object is created with the `question` as the `page_content` and the `annotation_id`, `app_id`, and `doc_id` (set to `annotation_id`) as metadata.
   - A `Vector` object is created using the `Dataset` object, and the `create` method is called to add the `Document` to the index, with a `duplicate_check` parameter set to `True`.
   - If the indexing process is successful, a success message is logged with the latency of the operation. If an exception occurs, an error message is logged.

In summary, this file defines a Celery task that is responsible for adding an annotation to an index. The task retrieves the necessary information, creates the required objects, and then adds the annotation to the index.

### Highlights

The key features of this code are:

1. **Celery Task**: The code defines a Celery shared task called `add_annotation_to_index_task` that is executed in the `dataset` queue.

2. **Annotation Indexing**: The task's purpose is to add an annotation to an index. It takes in parameters like `annotation_id`, `question`, `tenant_id`, `app_id`, and `collection_binding_id`.

3. **Dataset and Document Creation**: The task creates a `Dataset` object with specific configurations and a `Document` object containing the `question` as the page content and metadata about the annotation.

4. **Vector Creation and Indexing**: The task then creates a `Vector` object using the `Dataset` and adds the `Document` to the index, performing a duplicate check.

5. **Logging and Timing**: The task logs the start and end of the indexing process, including the latency, using the `logging` module and `click.style` for formatting.

The key focus of this code is the process of adding an annotation to an index, including the creation of the necessary data objects and the actual indexing operation. The Celery task framework is used to execute this operation asynchronously.```python

from core.rag.datasource.vdb.vector_factory import Vector

# Define a Celery task to add an annotation to the index
@shared_task(queue='dataset')
def add_annotation_to_index_task(annotation_id: str, question: str, tenant_id: str, app_id: str, collection_binding_id: str):
    """
    Add an annotation to the index.
    
    Parameters:
    annotation_id (str): The ID of the annotation
    question (str): The question associated with the annotation
    tenant_id (str): The ID of the tenant
    app_id (str): The ID of the application
    collection_binding_id (str): The ID of the collection binding
    """
    # Log the start of the task
    logging.info(click.style(f'Start build index for annotation: {annotation_id}', fg='green'))
    start_at = time.perf_counter()

    try:
        # Retrieve the dataset collection binding by ID and type
        dataset_collection_binding = DatasetCollectionBindingService.get_dataset_collection_binding_by_id_and_type(
            collection_binding_id,
            'annotation'
        )

        # Create a dataset instance with the required attributes
        dataset = Dataset(
            id=app_id,
            tenant_id=tenant_id,
            indexing_technique='high_quality',
            embedding_model_provider=dataset_collection_binding.provider_name,
            embedding_model=dataset_collection_binding.model_name,
            collection_binding_id=dataset_collection_binding.id
        )

        # Create a document instance with the question and metadata
        document = Document(
            page_content=question,
            metadata={
                "annotation_id": annotation_id,
                "app_id": app_id,
                "doc_id": annotation_id
            }
        )

        # Create a vector instance and add the document to the index
        vector = Vector(dataset, attributes=['doc_id', 'annotation_id', 'app_id'])
        vector.create([document], duplicate_check=True)

        # Log the successful completion of the task
        end_at = time.perf_counter()
        logging.info(
            click.style(
                f'Build index successful for annotation: {annotation_id} latency: {end_at - start_at}',
                fg='green'
            )
        )
    except Exception:
        # Log the failure of the task
        logging.exception("Build index for annotation failed")
```

This pseudocode describes the high-level logic of the `add_annotation_to_index_task` function. It starts by importing the necessary modules and libraries, then defines the Celery task function with the appropriate parameters. Inside the function, it logs the start of the task, retrieves the dataset collection binding, creates a dataset instance, creates a document instance with the provided question and metadata, creates a vector instance, and adds the document to the index. Finally, it logs the successful completion of the task or the failure if an exception occurs.

The pseudocode is written in a Pythonic style, with clear and descriptive variable names, function docstrings, and comments explaining the overall purpose of the code.
