    "highlights": "The key features of the provided code are:\n\n1. **Imports**: The code imports the `get` function from the `./base` module and the `CurrentPlanInfoBackend` and `SubscriptionUrlsBackend` types from the `@/app/components/billing/type` module.\n\n2. **Fetch Current Plan Info**: The `fetchCurrentPlanInfo` function is defined, which returns a promise that resolves to a `CurrentPlanInfoBackend` object. This function is likely used to retrieve the user's current plan information.\n\n3. **Fetch Subscription URLs**: The `fetchSubscriptionUrls` function is defined, which takes a `plan` and an `interval` parameter and returns a promise that resolves to a `SubscriptionUrlsBackend` object. This function is likely used to retrieve the URLs for managing the user's subscription.\n\n4. **Fetch Billing URL**: The `fetchBillingUrl` function is defined, which returns a promise that resolves to an object with a `url` property. This function is likely used to retrieve the URL for the user's billing information.\n\n5. **API Calls**: All three functions use the `get` function from the `./base` module to make HTTP GET requests to the server. This suggests that the code is part of a larger application that interacts with a backend API.\n\nThe key thing to look for in this code is the functionality it provides for fetching and managing the user's billing information, such as their current plan, subscription details, and billing URLs.",
    "overall_summary": "Based on the provided code, this is a TypeScript file named `billing.ts` that exports three functions:\n\n1. `fetchCurrentPlanInfo()`: This function fetches the current plan information from the backend and returns a `CurrentPlanInfoBackend` object.\n\n2. `fetchSubscriptionUrls(plan: string, interval: string)`: This function fetches the subscription URLs from the backend based on the provided `plan` and `interval` parameters. It returns a `SubscriptionUrlsBackend` object.\n\n3. `fetchBillingUrl()`: This function fetches the billing URL from the backend and returns an object with a `url` property.\n\nThe code imports the `get` function from a file named `base`, and it also imports the types `CurrentPlanInfoBackend` and `SubscriptionUrlsBackend` from the `@/app/components/billing/type` module.\n\nOverall, this codebase appears to be part of a larger application that deals with billing-related functionality, such as fetching information about the current plan, subscription URLs, and the billing URL.",

Here's a breakdown of the key components:\n\n1. **Import Statements**: The necessary modules and types are imported, including the `requests` library for making HTTP requests and the `TypedDict` class from the `typing` module for defining the structure of the response data.\n\n2. **Type Definitions**: The `CurrentPlanInfoBackend` and `SubscriptionUrlsBackend` types are defined using `TypedDict`, which allows for type-safe access to the response data.\n\n3. **Function Definitions**:\n   - `fetch_current_plan_info()`: Fetches the current plan information from the backend and returns the data as a `CurrentPlanInfoBackend` object.\n   - `fetch_subscription_urls(plan, interval)`: Fetches the subscription URLs for the given plan and billing interval, and returns the data as a `SubscriptionUrlsBackend` object.\n   - `fetch_billing_url()`: Fetches the billing URL and returns it as a dictionary.\n\nThe pseudocode uses clear and concise function names, type annotations, and docstrings to provide a high-level, Pythonic implementation of the original TypeScript code. This makes the logic easy to understand and maintain, even without detailed knowledge of the underlying implementation details.",
