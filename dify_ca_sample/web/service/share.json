    "highlights": "The key features of this code are:\n\n1. **API Functions**: The code provides a set of functions that interact with various API endpoints, such as sending chat messages, fetching conversations, managing conversations, and fetching app-related information.\n\n2. **Installed App vs. Public API**: The code differentiates between interactions with an installed app and the public API, using the `isInstalledApp` parameter to determine the appropriate API endpoint and request method.\n\n3. **Streaming and Blocking API Responses**: The code supports both streaming and blocking API responses, using the `response_mode` parameter to indicate the desired response mode.\n\n4. **Callback Functions**: Many of the API functions accept callback functions, such as `onData`, `onCompleted`, `onThought`, `onFile`, `onError`, `onMessageEnd`, and `onMessageReplace`, which allow for handling the API response in a more event-driven manner.\n\n5. **Utility Functions**: The code includes utility functions like `getUrl` and `getAction`, which help to construct the appropriate API endpoint and request method based on the `isInstalledApp` and `installedAppId` parameters.\n\nOverall, the key focus of this code is to provide a set of reusable functions for interacting with a variety of API endpoints, while also handling the differences between installed app and public API interactions.",
    "overall_summary": "This TypeScript file appears to be a shared module that provides various functions for interacting with a backend API. Here's a high-level overview of the codebase:\n\n1. **Utility Functions**:\n   - `getAction`: Returns the appropriate API action (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE) based on whether the app is an \"installed app\" or not.\n   - `getUrl`: Constructs the appropriate URL for the API endpoint based on whether the app is an \"installed app\" or not.\n\n2. **Chat-related Functions**:\n   - `sendChatMessage`: Sends a chat message to the backend and handles the response stream.\n   - `stopChatMessageResponding`: Stops the response stream for a chat message.\n   - `sendCompletionMessage`: Sends a completion message to the backend and handles the response stream.\n\n3. **Conversation-related Functions**:\n   - `fetchConversations`: Fetches a list of conversations.\n   - `pinConversation`, `unpinConversation`, `delConversation`: Perform actions on a conversation.\n   - `renameConversation`, `generationConversationName`: Manage the name of a conversation.\n\n4. **Other Functions**:\n   - `fetchAppInfo`: Fetches information about the app.\n   - `fetchChatList`: Fetches a list of chat messages for a given conversation.\n   - `fetchAppParams`: Fetches the app's configuration parameters.\n   - `fetchAppMeta`: Fetches the app's metadata.\n   - `updateFeedback`: Updates feedback information.\n   - `fetchMoreLikeThis`: Fetches more messages similar to a given message.\n   - `saveMessage`, `fetchSavedMessage`, `removeMessage`: Manage saved messages.\n   - `fetchSuggestedQuestions`: Fetches suggested questions for a given message.\n   - `audioToText`, `textToAudio`: Convert audio to text and vice versa.\n   - `fetchAccessToken`: Fetches an access token for the app.\n\nThis codebase appears to be a comprehensive module that handles various aspects of a chat-based application, including sending and receiving chat messages, managing conversations, and interacting with the backend API.",
