### Summary

Here's an overall summary of the codebase:

1. **Annotation Management**:
   - The codebase provides functionality for managing annotations within an application.
   - It includes methods to:
     - Fetch the current annotation configuration for an application.
     - Update the annotation status (enable/disable) and associated settings, such as the embedding model configuration and score threshold.
     - Update the annotation score threshold for a specific setting.
     - Query the status of an annotation-related job.
     - Fetch a list of annotations for an application, including the ability to export the list.
     - Add a new annotation to an application.
     - Perform batch import of annotations.
     - Check the progress of a batch import job.
     - Edit an existing annotation.
     - Delete an annotation.
     - Fetch the hit history for a specific annotation.

2. **API Structure**:
   - The codebase uses the `swr` library for handling fetching and caching of data.
   - It defines various API endpoints for interacting with the annotation-related functionalities, such as `apps/{appId}/annotation-setting`, `apps/{appId}/annotation-reply/{action}`, `apps/{appId}/annotations`, etc.
   - It utilizes helper functions (`get`, `post`, `del`) from the `base` module to make HTTP requests to these endpoints.

3. **Types and Constants**:
   - The codebase imports and uses various types, such as `AnnotationEnableStatus`, `AnnotationItemBasic`, and `EmbeddingModelConfig`, which are likely defined in a separate module (`@/app/components/app/annotation/type`).
   - It also references a constant `ANNOTATION_DEFAULT` from the `@/config` module, which seems to be the default value for the score threshold.

In summary, this codebase provides a set of functions to manage annotations within an application, including fetching and updating configuration, enabling/disabling annotations, handling batch imports, and querying annotation-related data.

### Highlights

The key features of the code you provided are:

1. **API Wrapper Functions**: The code defines a set of functions that act as a wrapper around various API endpoints related to annotations. These functions include `fetchAnnotationConfig`, `updateAnnotationStatus`, `updateAnnotationScore`, `queryAnnotationJobStatus`, `fetchAnnotationList`, `fetchExportAnnotationList`, `addAnnotation`, `annotationBatchImport`, `checkAnnotationBatchImportProgress`, `editAnnotation`, `delAnnotation`, and `fetchHitHistoryList`.

2. **Type Imports**: The code imports several types, including `Fetcher` from `swr`, and various annotation-related types from `@/app/components/app/annotation/type`.

3. **Utility Imports**: The code imports utility functions `del`, `get`, and `post` from `./base`, which are likely used to make HTTP requests to the API endpoints.

4. **Configuration Import**: The code imports the `ANNOTATION_DEFAULT` constant from `@/config`, which is likely used to provide default values for the annotation settings.

5. **Batch Import and Progress Tracking**: The code includes two specialized functions, `annotationBatchImport` and `checkAnnotationBatchImportProgress`, which seem to handle the batch import of annotations and tracking the progress of the import process, respectively.

Overall, the key focus of this code is to provide a set of utility functions that abstract the interaction with various annotation-related API endpoints, allowing the application to easily manage and interact with annotation data.```python
