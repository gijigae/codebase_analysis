### Summary

This code is a TypeScript file named `explore.ts` that exports several functions related to interacting with an "Explore" feature in an application.

The main functions are:

1. `fetchAppList()`: This function retrieves a list of app categories and recommended apps from the `/explore/apps` endpoint.

2. `fetchAppDetail(id)`: This function retrieves the details of a specific app by its ID from the `/explore/apps/{id}` endpoint.

3. `fetchInstalledAppList()`: This function retrieves a list of installed apps from the `/installed-apps` endpoint.

4. `installApp(id)`: This function installs an app by sending a POST request to the `/installed-apps` endpoint with the `app_id` in the request body.

5. `uninstallApp(id)`: This function uninstalls an app by sending a DELETE request to the `/installed-apps/{id}` endpoint.

6. `updatePinStatus(id, isPinned)`: This function updates the pin status of an installed app by sending a PATCH request to the `/installed-apps/{id}` endpoint with the `is_pinned` value in the request body.

7. `getToolProviders()`: This function retrieves a list of tool providers from the `/workspaces/current/tool-providers` endpoint.

The code uses the `get`, `post`, `patch`, and `del` functions from a `base` module to make the HTTP requests to the various endpoints.

Overall, this codebase provides a set of functions for interacting with the "Explore" feature of the application, allowing users to browse and manage installed apps.

### Highlights

The key features of this code are:

1. **API Calls**: The code defines several functions that make API calls to fetch and manipulate data related to apps and installed apps. These functions include `fetchAppList`, `fetchAppDetail`, `fetchInstalledAppList`, `installApp`, `uninstallApp`, `updatePinStatus`, and `getToolProviders`.

2. **Typed Responses**: The `fetchAppList` function returns a typed response, which includes `categories` and `recommended_apps` properties of type `AppCategory[]` and `App[]` respectively. This suggests that the API response is well-structured and the code is using TypeScript to ensure type safety.

3. **CRUD Operations**: The code includes functions for creating (installing an app), reading (fetching app lists), updating (updating pin status), and deleting (uninstalling an app) app-related data, demonstrating a full set of CRUD operations.

4. **Error Handling**: The `fetchAppDetail` function returns a Promise, which suggests that the API call may fail, and the error handling is likely handled elsewhere in the code.

5. **Modularity**: The code is organized into separate functions, each with a specific responsibility, which promotes modularity and maintainability.

Overall, this code appears to be part of a larger application that manages the installation and configuration of various apps. The key focus seems to be on providing a seamless interface for users to discover, install, and manage these apps.```python

    return get('/explore/apps')

def fetch_app_detail(app_id):
    """

    Args:

    return get(f'/explore/apps/{app_id}')

def fetch_installed_app_list():

    """
    return delete(f'/installed-apps/{app_id}')

def update_pin_status(app_id, is_pinned):
    """
    Update the pin status of an installed app.
    
    Args:

        is_pinned (bool): The new pin status of the app.
    
    Returns:
        The response from the server indicating the success or failure of the update.

def get_tool_providers():

```

The above pseudocode provides a high-level overview of the functions available in the `explore.ts` file. Each function is documented with a brief description, the expected input parameters, and the expected return value. The functions cover various tasks related to fetching app lists, installing and uninstalling apps, updating app pin status, and retrieving tool providers.

The code uses a consistent naming convention, with function names that clearly describe their purpose. The function signatures are designed to be intuitive and easy to use, with appropriate parameter and return types.

The overall structure of the code is organized and modular, making it easy to maintain and extend in the future.
