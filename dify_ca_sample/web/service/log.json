    "highlights": "The key features of this code are:\n\n1. **API Endpoints**: The code defines several API endpoints for fetching and updating data related to chat and text generation conversations, including:\n   - Fetching the list of conversations\n   - Fetching the details of a specific conversation\n   - Fetching the messages within a conversation\n   - Updating the feedback and annotations for a log message\n\n2. **Fetcher Functions**: The code uses the `Fetcher` type from the `swr` library to define functions that handle the API requests. These fetcher functions take parameters and return the expected response types.\n\n3. **API Requests**: The code uses the `get` and `post` functions from the `./base` module to make the actual API requests to the specified endpoints.\n\n4. **Response Types**: The code defines various response types (e.g., `ConversationListResponse`, `ChatConversationFullDetailResponse`) that correspond to the data returned by the API endpoints.\n\n5. **Modular Structure**: The code is organized in a modular way, with the various API endpoint functions and response types separated into different sections of the file.\n\nThe key thing to look for in this code is the set of API endpoints and the associated fetcher functions that handle the requests and responses. This code provides a convenient interface for interacting with the chat and text generation APIs.",
    "overall_summary": "This codebase is a TypeScript file named `log.ts` that provides a set of functions for interacting with a backend API related to chat and text generation applications. Here's a summary of the main components:\n\n1. **Imports**: The file imports various types and functions from other modules, including `Fetcher` from `swr`, and several types related to API responses.\n\n2. **Conversation List**: There are two functions for fetching conversation lists:\n   - `fetchConversationList`: Fetches a list of conversations for a given application ID.\n   - `fetchCompletionConversations`: Fetches a list of conversations for a text generation application.\n\n3. **Conversation Details**: There are two functions for fetching conversation details:\n   - `fetchCompletionConversationDetail`: Fetches the full details of a text generation application conversation.\n   - `fetchChatConversationDetail`: Fetches the full details of a chat application conversation.\n\n4. **Chat Messages**: The `fetchChatMessages` function fetches the messages for a specific chat application conversation.\n\n5. **Feedback and Annotations**: There are two functions for updating log message feedback and annotations:\n   - `updateLogMessageFeedbacks`: Updates the feedback for a log message.\n   - `updateLogMessageAnnotations`: Updates the annotations for a log message.\n\n6. **Annotations Count**: The `fetchAnnotationsCount` function fetches the count of annotations for a given URL.\n\nOverall, this codebase provides a set of utility functions for interacting with the backend API, allowing the application to fetch and update information related to chat and text generation conversations, messages, and annotations.",

The high-level pseudocode above abstracts away the implementation details and focuses on the overall functionality of the code.\n\nThe key aspects of the pseudocode include:\n\n1. **Utility Functions**: The `get` and `post` functions are defined to encapsulate the logic for making HTTP requests to the API.\n2. **Fetch Functions**: These functions are responsible for fetching data from the API, such as conversation lists, session details, and message lists. They accept relevant parameters and return the response data.\n3. **Update Functions**: These functions are responsible for updating data in the API, such as log message feedbacks and annotations. They accept the necessary request body and return the response data.\n4. **Annotations Count**: The `fetch_annotations_count` function is responsible for fetching the count of annotations.\n\nThe pseudocode follows a Pythonic style, using type annotations, docstrings, and meaningful function names to provide a high-level overview of the functionality without getting into the implementation details.",
