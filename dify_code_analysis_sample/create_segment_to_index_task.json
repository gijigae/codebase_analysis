    "highlights": "The key features of this code are:\n\n1. **Asynchronous Task**: This code is a Celery shared task, which means it is designed to be executed asynchronously in the background. The `@shared_task(queue='dataset')` decorator is used to define this function as a Celery task.\n\n2. **Document Indexing**: The main purpose of this code is to index a document segment. It retrieves the document segment from the database, creates a `Document` object with the segment's content and metadata, and then uses an `IndexProcessor` to load the document into the appropriate index.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: The code is wrapped in a try-except block to handle any exceptions that may occur during the indexing process. If an exception is raised, the segment's status is updated to 'error' and the error message is stored.\n\n4. **Database and Cache Interactions**: The code interacts with the database using SQLAlchemy to retrieve and update the document segment, and it also interacts with Redis to manage an indexing cache key.\n\n5. **Logging and Timing**: The code logs the start and end of the indexing process, and it measures the latency of the operation. This is useful for monitoring and debugging purposes.\n\nOverall, this code is responsible for handling the asynchronous indexing of a document segment, with robust error handling and logging to ensure the process is reliable and can be monitored effectively.",
    "overall_summary": "Here's an overall summary of the codebase:\n\n1. **create_segment_to_index_task**: This is a Celery task that is responsible for creating a segment to be indexed. The task takes in a `segment_id` and an optional list of `keywords`.\n\n2. **Functionality**:\n   - Retrieves the `DocumentSegment` object from the database based on the `segment_id`.\n   - Checks if the segment's status is 'waiting' and updates it to 'indexing'.\n   - Creates a `Document` object with the segment's content and metadata.\n   - Retrieves the dataset and document associated with the segment.\n   - Checks if the document is enabled, not archived, and has a completed indexing status.\n   - Initializes an `IndexProcessor` based on the dataset's document form and loads the document into the index.\n   - Updates the segment's status to 'completed'.\n   - Handles exceptions by disabling the segment, setting the status to 'error', and storing the error message.\n   - Deletes the indexing cache key from Redis.\n\n3. **Dependencies**:\n   - The task uses the `datetime`, `logging`, `time`, and `typing` modules from the Python standard library.\n   - It also depends on the `click`, `celery`, and `werkzeug.exceptions` libraries.\n   - It interacts with the `IndexProcessorFactory`, `Document`, `DocumentSegment`, and `Dataset` models, as well as the `db` and `redis_client` extensions.\n\n4. **Design Patterns**:\n   - The `create_segment_to_index_task` function is a Celery shared task, which allows it to be executed asynchronously.\n   - The `IndexProcessorFactory` is used to create the appropriate `IndexProcessor` based on the dataset's document form.\n   - The code follows a modular design, separating concerns between the task, models, and extensions.\n\nOverall, this codebase is responsible for managing the asynchronous creation and indexing of document segments, ensuring that the process is efficient and reliable.",

The function is defined as a Celery shared task, which means it can be executed asynchronously.\n2. The function fetches the segment from the database and checks if it's in the 'waiting' status.\n3. The function creates a Document object from the segment's content and initializes the appropriate index processor based on the dataset's document form.\n4. The function loads the document into the index and updates the segment's status to 'completed'.\n5. The function handles any exceptions that occur during the indexing process and disables and updates the segment on error.\n6. The function deletes the indexing cache key after the task is completed.\n\nThe pseudocode includes several helper functions that are not defined in the original code, such as `get_segment_from_db`, `update_segment_status`, `create_document_from_segment`, `get_dataset_from_segment`, `get_document_data_from_segment`, `is_dataset_and_document_valid`, `initialize_index_processor`, `disable_and_update_segment_on_error`, and `delete_indexing_cache_key`. These functions would need to be implemented separately to complete the functionality of the `create_segment_to_index_task` function.",
