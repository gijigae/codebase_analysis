    "highlights": "The key features of this code are:\n\n1. **Asynchronous Task**: The `enable_segment_to_index_task` function is defined as a Celery shared task, which allows it to be executed asynchronously in the background.\n\n2. **Database Interaction**: The code interacts with the database using the `db.session.query()` method to retrieve a `DocumentSegment` instance. It also updates the `enabled`, `disabled_at`, `status`, and `error` fields of the segment.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: The code includes exception handling to catch any errors that may occur during the indexing process. If an error occurs, it logs the exception and updates the segment's status and error fields.\n\n4. **Indexing Logic**: The code creates a `Document` instance with the segment's content and metadata, and then uses an `IndexProcessorFactory` to load the document into the appropriate index.\n\n5. **Caching**: The code uses a Redis cache key to track the indexing status of the segment. This key is deleted after the indexing process is completed.\n\nOverall, the key feature of this code is the asynchronous task that enables a segment to be indexed, with robust error handling and database interaction to ensure the integrity of the indexing process.",
    "overall_summary": "Here's an overall summary of the codebase:\n\nThis Python file, `enable_segment_to_index_task.py`, contains a Celery task called `enable_segment_to_index_task`. This task is responsible for asynchronously enabling a document segment to be indexed.\n\nThe key functionality of the task is as follows:\n\n1. It takes a `segment_id` as an input parameter.\n2. It retrieves the `DocumentSegment` object from the database based on the `segment_id`.\n3. It checks if the segment has a 'completed' status. If not, it raises a `NotFound` exception.\n4. It creates a `Document` object with the segment's content and metadata (doc_id, doc_hash, document_id, dataset_id).\n5. It retrieves the dataset and document associated with the segment.\n6. It checks if the document is enabled, not archived, and has a 'completed' indexing status. If not, it logs a message and returns.\n7. It initializes an `IndexProcessor` based on the document's form and loads the document into the index.\n8. It logs the successful indexing of the segment and the latency.\n9. If any exception occurs during the process, it sets the segment's status to 'error', logs the exception, and commits the changes to the database.\n10. Finally, it deletes the indexing cache key from Redis.\n\nThe overall purpose of this task is to enable a document segment to be indexed by an `IndexProcessor`, which is likely part of a larger document indexing and search system.",
