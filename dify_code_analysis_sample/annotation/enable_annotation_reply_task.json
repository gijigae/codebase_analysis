    "highlights": "The key features of this code are:\n\n1. **Asynchronous Task**: This code is defined as a Celery shared task, which means it runs asynchronously in the background. This allows the main application to continue processing without waiting for this task to complete.\n\n2. **Database and Redis Interactions**: The code interacts with both a database (using SQLAlchemy) and Redis (using a Redis client) to perform various operations, such as querying for app and annotation data, updating annotation settings, and storing task status information.\n\n3. **App and Annotation Handling**: The code retrieves an app and its associated annotations from the database, and then processes the annotations by creating document objects and adding them to a vector index.\n\n4. **Indexing Annotations**: The code creates a new dataset and vector index to store the app's annotations, using the specified embedding provider and model. It also handles deleting any existing annotations from the index before adding the new ones.\n\n5. **Error Handling and Logging**: The code includes extensive error handling and logging to capture and report any issues that may occur during the task execution. It uses the `logging` module and `click.style` to provide colored and informative log messages.\n\nThe key thing to look for in this code is the asynchronous task execution and the integration with both a database and a Redis cache to manage the app annotation data and task status.",
    "overall_summary": "This Python file `enable_annotation_reply_task.py` contains a single Celery shared task function called `enable_annotation_reply_task`. This task is responsible for enabling annotation reply functionality for a given application.\n\nThe main functionality of the task includes:\n\n1. Retrieving the application information from the database based on the provided `app_id`, `tenant_id`, and checking that the app status is 'normal'.\n2. Fetching all the message annotations associated with the given `app_id`.\n3. Updating or creating a new `AppAnnotationSetting` record in the database, which includes setting the `score_threshold`, `collection_binding_id`, `updated_user_id`, and `updated_at`.\n4. Creating a new `Dataset` record in the database for the application, with the provided `embedding_provider_name`, `embedding_model_name`, and `collection_binding_id`.\n5. Iterating through the retrieved message annotations, creating `Document` objects for each annotation, and adding them to the dataset using the `Vector` class.\n6. Committing the database changes and setting a Redis key to indicate the completion of the task.\n\nIn case of any exceptions, the task logs the error, sets a Redis key to indicate an error, and rolls back the database changes.\n\nThe task is marked as a Celery shared task, which means it can be called and executed asynchronously by the Celery worker processes.",

Define a Celery shared task to enable annotation reply asynchronously.\n2. Log the start of the task and measure the execution time.\n3. Fetch the app information from the database, and raise a `NotFound` exception if the app is not found.\n4. Fetch all the annotations for the app.\n5. Initialize the keys for Redis operations.\n6. Create a list of documents from the annotations.\n7. Get the dataset collection binding for the annotation use case.\n8. Update or create the app annotation setting.\n9. Create a new dataset for the app.\n10. Add the annotation documents to the index.\n11. Commit the database changes.\n12. Set the job completion status in Redis.\n13. Log the successful completion of the task.\n14. Handle any exceptions that may occur during the task execution.\n15. Remove the app annotation lock from Redis.\n\nThe pseudocode is designed to be highly abstract and informative, providing a clear overview of the high-level logic without delving into the implementation details.",
