    "highlights": "The key features of this code are:\n\n1. **Asynchronous Task**: The code defines a Celery shared task called `delete_annotation_index_task`, which is responsible for asynchronously deleting an annotation index.\n\n2. **Database Operations**: The task retrieves a `DatasetCollectionBinding` object from the database, and then creates a `Dataset` object to interact with the underlying vector database (VDB) for deleting the annotation index.\n\n3. **Vector Database Interaction**: The code uses the `Vector` class from the `core.rag.datasource.vdb.vector_factory` module to interact with the vector database and delete the annotation index based on the `annotation_id`.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: The code wraps the database and vector database operations in try-except blocks to handle any exceptions that may occur during the process.\n\n5. **Logging**: The code uses the `logging` module to log relevant information about the task execution, such as the start and end times, and any errors that may occur.\n\nOverall, the key focus of this code is to provide an asynchronous mechanism for deleting annotation indices from a vector database, with appropriate error handling and logging to ensure the reliability and observability of the process.",
    "overall_summary": "This Python file, `delete_annotation_index_task.py`, defines a Celery task called `delete_annotation_index_task`. This task is responsible for deleting an annotation index from a vector database.\n\nHere's a summary of the main components:\n\n1. **Imports**: The file imports several modules and classes, including `logging`, `time`, `click`, `shared_task` from Celery, and various classes from the `core.rag.datasource.vdb.vector_factory`, `models.dataset`, and `services.dataset_service` modules.\n\n2. **`delete_annotation_index_task`**: This is the main function of the file, decorated with `@shared_task(queue='dataset')`. It takes four parameters: `annotation_id`, `app_id`, `tenant_id`, and `collection_binding_id`. The function's purpose is to delete the annotation index from the vector database.\n\n   - It starts by logging an informational message using `logging.info` and `click.style`.\n   - It calculates the start time using `time.perf_counter()`.\n   - It retrieves the `DatasetCollectionBinding` object using the `DatasetCollectionBindingService.get_dataset_collection_binding_by_id_and_type` method.\n   - It creates a `Dataset` object with the provided `app_id`, `tenant_id`, `indexing_technique`, and `collection_binding_id`.\n   - It creates a `Vector` object with the `Dataset` object and attributes `['doc_id', 'annotation_id', 'app_id']`.\n   - It deletes the annotation index from the vector database using the `vector.delete_by_metadata_field` method, passing the `annotation_id` as the metadata field.\n   - It calculates the end time and logs an informational message using `logging.info` and `click.style`.\n   - If any exceptions occur during the process, it logs the error using `logging.exception`.\n\nThis codebase provides a way to delete an annotation index from a vector database asynchronously using a Celery task. The task retrieves the necessary information from the database, creates a vector object, and deletes the annotation index based on the provided `annotation_id`.",

The code defines a Celery shared task called `delete_annotation_index_task` that is executed asynchronously in the `dataset` queue.\n2. The task takes four parameters: `annotation_id`, `app_id`, `tenant_id`, and `collection_binding_id`.\n3. The task starts by logging the beginning of the process using the `click.style` function to make the log message more visible.\n4. It then fetches the dataset collection binding by its ID and type using the `DatasetCollectionBindingService`.\n5. A `Dataset` object is created with the provided information, including the `indexing_technique` and `collection_binding_id`.\n6. Inside a try-except block, a `Vector` object is created with the dataset, and the annotation index is deleted by its ID using the `delete_by_metadata_field` method.\n7. If the deletion of the annotation index fails, an exception is logged.\n8. Finally, the successful deletion of the annotation index is logged, including the time it took to complete the task.\n9. If an exception occurs at any point during the task, it is caught and logged.\n\nThe pseudocode provides a high-level overview of the task's functionality, including the input parameters, the main steps involved, and the error handling. This can be used as a starting point for understanding the purpose and implementation of the `delete_annotation_index_task` function.",
