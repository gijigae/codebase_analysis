    "highlights": "The key features of this code are:\n\n1. **Celery Task**: This code defines a Celery task called `update_annotation_to_index_task` that is executed in the 'dataset' queue.\n\n2. **Input Parameters**: The task takes 5 input parameters: `annotation_id`, `question`, `tenant_id`, `app_id`, and `collection_binding_id`. These parameters are used to update the annotation in the index.\n\n3. **Logging and Timing**: The task logs the start and end of the indexing process, and measures the latency of the operation.\n\n4. **Database Operations**: The task retrieves a dataset collection binding, creates a `Dataset` and a `Document` object, and then uses a `Vector` object to delete the existing annotation from the index and add the new annotation.\n\n5. **Exception Handling**: The task is wrapped in a try-except block to catch any exceptions that may occur during the indexing process.\n\nOverall, this code is responsible for updating an annotation in a search index, and it does so by leveraging Celery for asynchronous task execution, interacting with a database to retrieve necessary data, and handling potential errors that may occur during the process.",
    "overall_summary": "The code you provided appears to be a Python script named `update_annotation_to_index_task.py` located in the `annotation` directory. It is a Celery task that updates an annotation to an index.\n\nHere's a summary of the key components:\n\n1. **Imports**: The script imports several modules and classes, including `logging`, `time`, `click`, `celery`, and various classes from the `core.rag`, `models`, and `services` packages.\n\n2. **update_annotation_to_index_task**: This is the main function of the script, decorated with `@shared_task(queue='dataset')`, which makes it a Celery task. It takes the following parameters:\n   - `annotation_id`: The ID of the annotation to be updated.\n   - `question`: The question associated with the annotation.\n   - `tenant_id`: The tenant ID.\n   - `app_id`: The app ID.\n   - `collection_binding_id`: The ID of the collection binding.\n\n   The function performs the following steps:\n   - Logs the start of the task and records the start time.\n   - Retrieves the dataset collection binding based on the `collection_binding_id`.\n   - Creates a `Dataset` object with the provided information.\n   - Creates a `Document` object with the `question` as the `page_content` and metadata including the `annotation_id`, `app_id`, and `doc_id`.\n   - Creates a `Vector` object using the `Dataset` and adds the `Document` to it, deleting any existing vectors with the same `annotation_id` metadata.\n   - Logs the successful completion of the task and the latency.\n   - If an exception occurs during the task, it logs the failure.\n\nThe overall purpose of this script seems to be to update an annotation's index by creating a new `Document` and associated `Vector` in the dataset, while ensuring that any previous index entries for the same annotation are removed.",

It includes the following steps:\n\n1. Import the necessary modules and functions.\n2. Define a Celery shared task `update_annotation_to_index_task` that accepts the required parameters.\n3. Inside the task, log the start of the task and measure the execution time using `perf_counter()`.\n4. Retrieve the dataset collection binding by its ID and type.\n5. Create a `Dataset` instance with the required parameters.\n6. Create a `Document` instance with the question and metadata.\n7. Create a `Vector` instance, delete the existing annotation by its metadata field, and add the new document to the vector.\n8. Log the successful completion of the task, including the latency.\n9. Handle any exceptions that may occur during the task execution and log the failure.\n\nThe pseudocode provides a high-level, abstract representation of the task's functionality, making it easy to understand the overall logic without going into the specific implementation details.",
