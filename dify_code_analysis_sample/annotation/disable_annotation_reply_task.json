    "highlights": "The key features of this code are:\n\n1. **Asynchronous Task**: The code uses a Celery shared task `disable_annotation_reply_task` to execute the task asynchronously.\n\n2. **Data Retrieval and Update**: The code retrieves the App and AppAnnotationSetting objects from the database, and then updates or deletes the relevant data based on the task requirements.\n\n3. **Vector Database Interaction**: The code interacts with a vector database (presumably Pinecone or Elasticsearch) to delete annotations associated with the specified app.\n\n4. **Redis Usage**: The code uses Redis to store the status of the asynchronous task and any errors that occurred during the execution.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: The code includes robust error handling, logging errors and setting the appropriate task status in Redis if any exceptions occur during the task execution.\n\nOverall, the key focus of this code is to handle the disabling of annotation replies for a specific app, including updating the database, removing the annotations from the vector database, and managing the asynchronous task state and error reporting.",
    "overall_summary": "This Python file `disable_annotation_reply_task.py` contains a Celery shared task called `disable_annotation_reply_task`. This task is responsible for disabling the annotation reply functionality for a given application.\n\nThe main functionality of this task is as follows:\n\n1. It retrieves the application information from the database using the `App` model, based on the provided `app_id` and `tenant_id`.\n2. It retrieves the application annotation settings from the database using the `AppAnnotationSetting` model, based on the `app_id`.\n3. If the app or the app annotation settings are not found, it raises a `NotFound` exception.\n4. It sets a Redis key `disable_app_annotation_{app_id}` to indicate that the annotation reply is being disabled for this app.\n5. It creates a `Dataset` object using the `app_id`, `tenant_id`, `indexing_technique`, and `collection_binding_id` from the `AppAnnotationSetting` model.\n6. It uses the `Vector` class to delete the annotations associated with the `app_id` from the vector index.\n7. It deletes the `AppAnnotationSetting` record from the database.\n8. Finally, it sets a Redis key `disable_app_annotation_job_{job_id}` to indicate that the task has completed.\n\nIf any exceptions occur during the task execution, it sets a Redis key `disable_app_annotation_error_{job_id}` to store the error message.\n\nThe overall purpose of this code is to provide a way to disable the annotation reply functionality for a specific application, by removing the associated annotation data from the vector index and the database.",
