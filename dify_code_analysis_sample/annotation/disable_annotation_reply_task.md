### Summary

This Python file `disable_annotation_reply_task.py` contains a Celery shared task called `disable_annotation_reply_task`. This task is responsible for disabling the annotation reply functionality for a given application.

The main functionality of this task is as follows:

1. It retrieves the application information from the database using the `App` model, based on the provided `app_id` and `tenant_id`.
2. It retrieves the application annotation settings from the database using the `AppAnnotationSetting` model, based on the `app_id`.
3. If the app or the app annotation settings are not found, it raises a `NotFound` exception.
4. It sets a Redis key `disable_app_annotation_{app_id}` to indicate that the annotation reply is being disabled for this app.
5. It creates a `Dataset` object using the `app_id`, `tenant_id`, `indexing_technique`, and `collection_binding_id` from the `AppAnnotationSetting` model.
6. It uses the `Vector` class to delete the annotations associated with the `app_id` from the vector index.
7. It deletes the `AppAnnotationSetting` record from the database.
8. Finally, it sets a Redis key `disable_app_annotation_job_{job_id}` to indicate that the task has completed.

If any exceptions occur during the task execution, it sets a Redis key `disable_app_annotation_error_{job_id}` to store the error message.

The overall purpose of this code is to provide a way to disable the annotation reply functionality for a specific application, by removing the associated annotation data from the vector index and the database.

### Highlights

The key features of this code are:

1. **Asynchronous Task**: The code uses a Celery shared task `disable_annotation_reply_task` to execute the task asynchronously.

2. **Data Retrieval and Update**: The code retrieves the App and AppAnnotationSetting objects from the database, and then updates or deletes the relevant data based on the task requirements.

3. **Vector Database Interaction**: The code interacts with a vector database (presumably Pinecone or Elasticsearch) to delete annotations associated with the specified app.

4. **Redis Usage**: The code uses Redis to store the status of the asynchronous task and any errors that occurred during the execution.

5. **Error Handling**: The code includes robust error handling, logging errors and setting the appropriate task status in Redis if any exceptions occur during the task execution.

Overall, the key focus of this code is to handle the disabling of annotation replies for a specific app, including updating the database, removing the annotations from the vector database, and managing the asynchronous task state and error reporting.```python

```

This pseudocode follows a high-level, abstract approach to describe the functionality of the `disable_annotation_reply_task` function. It includes comments to explain the purpose of each section of the code, making it easy to understand the overall flow and logic of the task.

The key steps are:

1. Import the necessary modules and define the async task using the `@shared_task` decorator.
2. Fetch the app and app annotation settings from the database, raising exceptions if they are not found.
3. Set Redis keys for monitoring the task progress and completion.
4. Delete the annotations from the vector index, and delete the app annotation settings from the database.
5. Log the completion of the task, including the latency.
6. Handle any exceptions that may occur during the task execution, updating the task status and error information in Redis.
7. Clean up the Redis key for the task.

This pseudocode provides a high-level, abstract overview of the task's functionality, making it easy to understand the overall logic and flow of the code.
